👋 Hello, I’m @suong and I'm a Talent Acquisition Executive. 
I work a lot with developers so I want to get to know them better by digging a little deeper into technical things.
Sooo..
🌱 I’m currently learning HTML with support from my other half ^^

I find out that coding is something pretty cool and interesting 💞️
